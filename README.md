###### Scary warning: Most of these addons were made long ago during Feenix days, then a lot was changed/added to prepare for Corecraft. Since it died, they still haven't been extensively tested on modern servers.

## Purpose:
This will save the text of each chat tab and load it back when logging in. It's compatible with Chatter and Prat, but probably not with any other big chat addons that may exist.
